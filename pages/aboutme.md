Second year PhD student, I am working under the supervision of Julien Pilmé at the Laboratory of Theoretical Chemistry (LCT @UMR7616) at Sorbonne University. My work consists in developing a software package whose role is the prediction of chemical reactions. This new approach combines IQA energy decomposition on topological domains and conceptual DFT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 3 includes the residual plot and QQ-plot. The residual plot have no obvious pattern: the expect value of residuals is close to 0 and the variances are approximately equal. The QQ-plot shows the standardized residuals are close to the theoretical quantiles. Thus, **the residuals are normally distributed and homoscedastic, and the assumption of the liner model is satisfied**. The VIF values for each variable in the best model is small, indicating **there are no obvious multicolinearity**.
